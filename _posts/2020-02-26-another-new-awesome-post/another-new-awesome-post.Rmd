```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      fig.height = 7)

# remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Here's how to create a plot and display it in different ways 

```{r}

plot_1_a
# why is this not showing up on the website when I build? 

```

Now let's look at the the same plot a different way (see Figures code from slides) 

```{r layout = "l-body-outset"}


ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

```

```{r showing a table}

mpg %>%
  gt::gt()

```

```{r a fancier table}

mpg %>%
  reactable::reactable()

```
